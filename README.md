# chrome-h5a

H5A ("HTML5 Assessor") is a Chrome DevTools extension for checking
whether certain web technologies are being used in inspected web
pages.

It was created as the assignment for the course Special Assignment in
WWW and Knowledge Technology at [Aalto University](http://www.aalto.fi/)
in 2015.

[I](https://github.com/scop/) do not have any active plans for now to
continue the development but others might, so fork away if interested!
Some obvious areas with room for improvement include:
* Find a way to get rid of the required click of the "Reload" button to inject our scripts.
* Report findings automatically in real time without having to click the "Report" button.
* Make the results prettier, group by technology, etc.
* Make the error message when "Report" is clicked without our scripts injected better.
